To solve this final set of state values, we need to account for the -1 cost incurred every time you move to a new state, combined with the final goal of reaching state C for the +100 reward. 

I decided to use backward induction starting from C. 

C is the terminal state: Value = 100.
F can move to C: -1 + 100 = 99
J (moves to F) = -1 +99 = 98
I (Moves to J): -1 + 98 = 97
G (Moves to I): -1 + 97 = 96
H (Moves to I): -1 + 97 = 96
D (Moves to G): -1 + 96 = 95
E (Moves to D): -1 + 95 = 94
B (Moves to D): -1 + 95 = 94
S (Start - moves to B): -1 + 94 = 93
A (Moves to S): -1 + 93 = 92



and so on... please see final result below
state	value
A	    92
B	    94
C	    100
D	    95
E	    94
F	    99
G	    96
H	    96
I	    97
J	    98
S	    93
